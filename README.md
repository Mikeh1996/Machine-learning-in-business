# Machine Learning in Business – Regression Project

## Inspiration
This project marks my first exploration into regression modeling. After working with classification problems in earlier projects, I was excited to expand into regression and uncover how it can be applied in business contexts. I’m especially interested in understanding how machine learning can be connected to finance, and this project gave me a meaningful starting point to explore those intersections.

## Problem Statement
The project centers around evaluating the profitability of oil wells in three different regions using historical geological and production data. The goal is to identify which region is the most promising for investment by predicting the volume of extracted oil and assessing expected profit per well.

The regression model is trained to predict oil production based on a single feature: the volume of geological reserves. This prediction is then used in a profit estimation process that includes risk assessment and uncertainty quantification through bootstrapping.

## Project Goals
- Build a regression model to predict the volume of oil production based on available geological features.
- Estimate the profitability of each region using the predicted outputs.
- Use bootstrapping to simulate and assess risk and profit variability.
- Identify the best region to invest in based on expected profit and risk thresholds.

## Key Questions Explored
- How accurate is a linear regression model in predicting oil production?
- Which region offers the highest expected profit and the lowest financial risk?
- What is the impact of geological reserve estimates on predicted profit?
- How does bootstrapping help us evaluate uncertainty in business predictions?

## What I Learned from This Project
This project was a pivotal moment in my machine learning journey. Key takeaways included:

- Understanding how regression works and how it differs from classification.
- Building and evaluating linear regression models.
- Applying regression to real-world business use cases, like investment decision-making.
- Using bootstrapping to model uncertainty and support data-driven risk analysis.
- Developing a more intuitive sense of how machine learning methods like regression can be used in financial forecasting and scenario planning.
